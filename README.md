This are files I use in my demo for the Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCe2dpJKTBo

The "notebooks" folder contains the the Jupyter Notebook files I demo during my video. Jupyter notebooks can be viewed for free online at https://jupyter.org/ , and can be open in most popular IDEs.

The "python" folder includes the plain python files exported from the notebooks.
